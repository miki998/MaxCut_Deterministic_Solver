### MaxCut Solver
Documentation and implementation for Maximum Cut solving methods

### Structure
- graph_examples: graph generated by biqmaclib
- papers: part of papers used and cited in our paper
- personal_graph_examples: graph generated by ourselves
- enumerative.py: code for enumeration method
